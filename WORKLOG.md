# WORKLOG — WRIT 20833 2026 port (session handoff)

**Branch:** `claude/tender-thompson-13o19u` · **Last updated:** 2026-06-10

A running handoff so any new session (VS Code, web, or CLI) can resume with zero ramp-up.
Read this first, then `PORT_ASSESSMENT_2026.md` (context) and `PROPOSED_4WEEK_SCHEDULE.md`
(the plan + open decisions).

---

## Context in one paragraph
WRIT 20833 ("Intro to Coding in the Humanities") runs **online synchronous, 4 weeks,
2 hrs/day × 5 days ≈ 40 contact hours, starting 2026-07-06**. It is a **port** of the mature
16-week Fall 2025 course (`TCU-DCDA/WRIT20833_2025`) — not new content. Chosen scope: **drop
the web-dev/portfolio half** (overlaps MALA 60970), keeping Python foundations + the
cultural-analytics arc (term frequency → sentiment → topic modeling) into a notebook+essay
capstone. The contact-hour budget is comparable to F25, so this is re-pacing + a modest trim,
not a content cliff.

## Locked decisions
- Scope: drop portfolio half (tentative-but-working; see open decision #1).
- **VADER stays**; topic modeling is **Gensim** (F25 replaced MALLET with Gensim).
- **Walsh independence is course-wide** — Walsh is optional reading only, credited as
  inspiration/model in `ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md`.
- **Assignment renumbering (2026):** HW1 = foundations · HW2 = term freq · HW3 = freq+sentiment
  · HW4 = topic modeling+integration · Capstone. (F25 map: HW1=F25 HW2, HW2=F25 HW1,
  HW3=F25 HW4-1, HW4=F25 HW4-2.)
- Stylometry exercise placement: **close-reading seed on Day 7**, computational half +
  synthesis in **Week 4 / capstone track**.

## Done this session (all committed + pushed)
- `PORT_ASSESSMENT_2026.md` — readiness/port analysis (kept in F25 numbering; documents history).
- `PROPOSED_4WEEK_SCHEDULE.md` — 20-session draft (drop-portfolio scope, 2026 numbering).
- `ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md` — credits Walsh as inspiration/model.
- `notebooks/homework/WRIT20833_HW1_2026.ipynb` + `_ANSWER_KEY` — **HW1 (foundations),
  Walsh-independent**, 6/4/2 exercises + experiments; answer key runs clean (A4 uses
  try/except so the notebook runs top-to-bottom).
- `materials/stylometry/` — "Reading for the Seams" exercise: handout (`Reading_for_the_Seams.md`),
  computational notebook (`WRIT20833_Stylometry_Reading_Seams_2026.ipynb`, validated),
  and the `ai_voice_claude_analysis.pdf` exemplar.

## Open threads / next steps
1. **Confirm scope** — drop-portfolio (current) vs. full-arc-tightened vs. foundations-only.
2. **Build HW2 (term frequency)** — next Walsh-independent rebuild (F25 HW1 is the source;
   note F25's HW1 used provided F22 text files — decide on 2026 dataset, e.g. TenCommandments CSVs).
3. **Walsh-prereq strip on ported notebooks** — Tutorials 1–4 and the code-alongs open with an
   "assumes Walsh Ch 4–8" block; remove/replace as each is ported (HW1 already done).
4. **Port the carry-over-ready code-alongs** into this repo per the schedule (Variables already here;
   StrMethods/Conditionals/Loops, Lists/Loops, Dictionaries/Functions, Pandas 01/02, Instant Data
   Scraper, VADER, Topic Modeling). Dedup the topic-modeling notebooks (F25-canonical = combined Gensim).
5. **Author a 2026 syllabus** — none exists even in F25 (`WRIT20833_2025/docs/syllabus/index.md` is empty).
6. **Stylometry decisions** — fixed sample corpus vs. student-generated; essay weight; ethics emphasis.
7. **Test the topic-modeling install cell** (F25 HW4-2 pinned deps + runtime restart) on Colab's 2026 image.
8. **A4 / HW1 note:** A4 intentionally demonstrates a TypeError via try/except — by design.

## Useful facts for a fresh session
- The F25 source repo is **public**; if it's out of session scope, you can still read files via
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/TCU-DCDA/WRIT20833_2025/main/<path>` or `git clone` it (github.com is
  reachable). The Pages site `tcu-dcda.github.io` is NOT reachable from the sandbox allowlist.
- F25 full asset inventory is in that repo's `README.md`.
- No PR has been opened for this branch (per instructions — only on request).
